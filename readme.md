## Joachim's Running Log 

### Third Movement

This project is intended solely for me to have a web based logging tool for my runs. 
Earlier attempts were made, but never finished. 

### Strava

If you have a [Strava](http://strava.com) account, you can synchronize your workouts
and routes. At the time of this writing, I have no other plans for the Strava API.

### GPX import

Another way to import data, is through [the .gpx format](http://www.topografix.com/gpx.asp). 
You can upload a .gpx file, which is being parsed and translated into coordinates, 
distance and elapsed time. Neat!

### Forecast.io

One thing I always find important in tracking my results, is weather data. I run 
better in cold weather than in hot & stuffy weather. I built in the option of 
retrieving weather for a certain set of coordinates on a certain date and time. 
The [forecast.io](https://forecast.io) API allows the user to look into the past 
as well, so you can work on your logs days or even weeks after your workout.
